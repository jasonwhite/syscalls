[features]
default = ["use_std"]
# The 'use_std' feature permits the regex crate to use the standard library.
# This is intended to support future use cases where the regex crate may be
# able to compile without std, and instead just rely on 'core' and 'alloc'
# (for example). Currently, this isn't supported, and removing the 'use_std'
# feature will prevent regex from compiling.
